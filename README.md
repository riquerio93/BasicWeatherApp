# BasicWeatherApp
A very simple weather app made with Xamarin Forms and the OpenWeatherMap API.
Rush Written in 2 days! 

Input zipcode and you are provided weather results. You can favorite them too.
On pin top click the results are displayed as;

"item:item:item
data:data:data"

on pin bottom click you can favorite it.

Tested on iOS, no issues aside from favorites list display being incorrect (item source is correct just not display)
Not tested on android. Map may not have valid access key in native code, did not check
